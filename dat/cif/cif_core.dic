   1997-11-24  BMcM: Slightly changed wording of _reflns_number_Friedel and
                 _reflns_threshold_expression at suggestion of I.D.Brown.
                 Modified definition of _refine_ls_abs_structure_Flack and
                 changed the text of the example in category REFINE at
                 the request of H.D.Flack.
   1997-12-08  BMcM: Removed the phrase "(enantiomorph or polarity)" from
                 _refine_ls_abs_structure_Flack and *_Rogers because
                 "absolute structure" is a phrase uniquely defined (H.D.Flack)
   1997-12-08  BMcM: Several instances of \s changed to u
   1997-12-08  BMcM: Modified definitions of _reflns_number_total and
                 *_Friedel (after H.D.Flack) to clarify the distinction between
                 crystal-class and Laue-symmetry independent reflection sets
   1997-12-08  BMcM: Added _chemical_absolute_configuration and
                  _chemical_optical_rotation (H.D.Flack)
   1998-08-04  BMcM: Moved _diffrn_pressure_history and _diffrn_thermal_history
                  from draft msCIF dictionary to core as
                  _exptl_crystal_pressure_history and
                  _exptl_crystal_thermal_history (G. Madariaga/I.D.Brown)
                    Moved _diffrn_symmetry_description and REFINE_LS_CLASS
                  from draft msCIF dictionary to core (G. Madariaga/I.D.Brown)
   1998-08-04  BMcM: Minor rewordings of _refine_ls_R_Fsqd_factor,
                  _refine_ls_R_I_factor, various definitions referring to
                  F_calc in electrons, and _reflns_shell_number_unique_*
                  (I.D.Brown)
   1998-08-04  BMcM: added _reflns_Friedel_coverage (H.D.Flack/S.R.Hall)
   1998-08-04  BMcM: changed formula for F(000) (from
                  F(000) = [ sum (f~r~^2^ + f~i~^2^) ]^1/2^     to
                  F(000) = [ (sum f~r~)^2^ + (sum f~i~)^2^ ]^1/2^ ) (H.D.Flack)
   1998-08-04  BMcM: added 'syn' and 'unk' as enumerations to
                  _chemical_absolute_configuration (H.D.Flack/A.Linden)
   1998-09-02  BMcM: added _exptl_crystal_size_length and modified slightly
                  the definition of _exptl_crystal_size_ (W.Clegg/I.D.Brown)
                    Added _diffrn_attenuator_material (I.D.Brown)
                    Added sentence explaining the physical meaning of the
                  _enumeration_range to _refine_ls_abs_structure_Flack
                  (H.D.Flack)
                    Some rewording in _chemical_absolute_configuration implying
                  that for absolute configuration determination the measurement
                  and reporting of the optical rotation in solution are
                  considered mandatory. (H.D.Flack)
                    Some rewording in _reflns_number_total and *_gt to clarify
                  the inclusion of Friedel reflections; addition of
                  _reflns_Friedel_coverage; deletion of _reflns_number_Friedel
                  (H.D.Flack/S.R.Hall)
                    Further minor rewording to _reflns_shell_number_unique_all,
                  *_gt, *_obs (H.D.Flack)
   1998-09-10  BMcM: transferred _diffrn_reflns_number_of_classes and the
                  categories DIFFRN_REFLNS_CLASS, REFLNS_CLASS and
                  REFLNS_SHELL_CLASS from the draft msCIF dictionary; added
                  _diffrn_refln_class_code and _refln_class_code to link
                  individual reflections to their related categories.
   1998-12-08  BMcM: implemented H.D. Flack's reworking of DIFFRN_REFLNS_CLASS,
                  REFLNS_CLASS, REFLNS_SHELL_CLASS and REFINE_LS_CLASS, deleting
                  the latter two; removed _diffrn_reflns_number_of_classes.
   1998-12-15  BMcM: completed the above reworking; fixed embarrassing typo for
                  _related_function
   1999-01-16  BMcM: coreDMG review of version 2.1beta5. Numerous small changes
                  from I.D.Brown, the most significant being:
                   _atom_site_occupancy definition clarifies how to impose an
                    experimental uncertainty on the _enumeration_range;
                   _atom_site_U_iso_or_equiv enumeration range set to infinity;
                   _atom_type_analytical_mass_% enumeration range set as 0:100;
                   expanded definitions of _diffrn_radiation_probe and *_type to
                    clarify the distinction between these two items;
                   added reference to _exptl_crystal_size to the definition of
                    _exptl_crystal_description, and modified the definition of
                    _exptl_crystal_face_diffr_ ;
                   new data item _refln_d_spacing;
                   clarified the role of _reflns_special_details in specifying
                    whether Friedel pairs have been averaged;
                  Numerous small changes from H.D.Flack, most significantly:
                   removed enumeration range from _diffrn_refln_counts_ because
                    *_net can go negative;
                   fixed various typos in equations for wR and S;
                   removed reference to Friedel reflections from
                    _refln_symmetry_multiplicity
   1999-01-24  BMcM: further revision to wording of _refln_symmetry_multiplicity
                   following discussions by HDF and IDB
                  Numerous small changes from G.Madariaga, most significantly:
                   a instead of A for real-space cell lengths
                    (_atom_site_B_iso_or_equiv and _atom_site_U_iso_or_equiv);
                   _related_function alternate for _atom_site_Cartn_ & _fract_;
                   "or scattering lengths" added to _atom_type_scat_source;
                   deleted incorrect _list_reference in DIFFRN_RADIATION;
                   added rtf to enumeration in _publ_body_format;
                   added enumeration range to _refine_ls_abs_structure_Rogers
   1999-02-04  BMcM: fixed some long lines
   1999-02-06  BMcM: data names using sigma as an indicator of experimental
                     standard uncertainty replaced by equivalents using the
                     preferred 'u' notation (HDF):
                          _diffrn_refln_intensity_sigma
                          _diffrn_reflns_av_sigmaI/netI
                          _diffrn_reflns_class_av_sgI/I
                          _diffrn_standards_scale_sigma
                          _reflns_shell_meanI_over_sigI_all
                          _reflns_shell_meanI_over_sigI_gt
                 (_reflns_shell_meanI_over_sigI_obs already replaced by *_gt)
                   addition of '_related function alternate' to new data
                     items corresponding to old items with
                     '_related_function replace' (SRH)
                   Example for _citation_journal_id_CSD changed to 0070 to
                     reflect current practice at PDB (F.C.Bernstein)
                   Added _atom_type_scat_dispersion_source (GM)
   1999-03-24  Some minor cosmetic modifications (BMcM)

                     (H.D.Flack)
                     Added _geom_bond_valence and the new categories
                     VALENCE_PARAM and VALENCE_REF (I.D.Brown)
   2001-01-11  BMcM: Categories EI, EO, EM added to _publ_requested_category
   2001-01-11  Release version 2.2. IUCr
   2003-09-28  BMcM: incorporated changes approved by COMCIFS following
                     discussions of the core Dictionary Management Group:
               _atom_site_fract_ nonsense enumeration default value removed
               _atom_site_refinement_flags deprecated in favour of new
                     *_flags_posn, *_adp and *_occupancy items

               _cell_reciprocal_angle_ and *_length_ added
               '_type_conditions esd' added to _chemical_melting_point
               _chemical_melting_point_gt and *_lt added
               Added several new items describing chemical properties to
                     the CHEMICAL category: _chemical_properties_biological and
                     *_physical, _chemical_temperature_decomposition_* and
                     *_sublimation_*, at the request of CCDC
               _citation_database_id_CSD added at request of CCDC
               Several additional tags storing deposition numbers of
                     database entries and record revision history at
                     request of CCDC: _database_code_depnum_ccdc_fiz,
                     *_journal, *_archive and _database_CSD_history
               Added _diffrn_ambient_pressure_gt,lt and *_temperature_gt,lt
               Added _diffrn_source_take-off_angle
               Added _diffrn_standards_decay_%_lt
               _diffrn_reflns_measured_fraction_resolution_full and *_max
                     introduced as replacements for
                     _diffrn_measured_fraction_theta_full and *_max, moved
                     to a more appropriate category and defined in terms
                     of resolution rather than angle which depends on the
                     radiation used.
               Likewise for _diffrn_reflns_resolution_full and *_max as
                     replacements for _diffrn_reflns_theta_full and *_max
               More specific parsable tags for crystal colour introduced as

               Added _exptl_crystal_recrystallization_method
               Added _publ_contact_author_id_iucr and _publ_author_id_iucr
                     to allow unique author identification by IUCr database
                     reference identifier
               More datanames for recording imprecise quantities:
                     _refine_ls_shift/su_max_lt and _refine_ls_shift/su_mean_lt
               Added the categories SPACE_GROUP and SPACE_GROUP_SYMOP
                     as imports from the symmetry dictionary cif_sym.dic
               Added _related_function 'replace' to a number of items in
                     the old SYMMETRY category pointing to the preferred
                     items from the new SPACE_GROUP category
   2003-08-19  BMcM: formal approval for COMCIFS for the additions and
                     contingent changes discussed on the coreDMG discussion
                     list from June 2002
   2003-09-29  BMcM: second round of changes from coreDMG discussions:
               Added _enumeration_range to new _chemical_temperature_* items;
               Expanded definition of _space_group_symop_operation_xyz to
                     make explicit the need for inclusion of centring
                     translations (HDF/IDB)
               Removed _diffrn_reflns_measured_fraction_resolution_full and
                     *_max for reconsideration following suggestion by
                     Curt Haltiwanger that terms are needed that do not
                     refer to resolution or theta
               Likewise removed _diffrn_standards_decay_%_lt for further
                     consideration, and added _type_conditions esd to
                     _diffrn_standards_decay_% as a measurable quantity
                     (CH/HDF)
               Modified _example_detail for _space_group_symop_operation_xyz
                     to use a full and unambiguous wording in accordance
                     with International Tables A (CH/IDB/HDF)
   2003-09-29  Removed "_type_conditions esd" from the remaining *_gt and
                     *_lt items at the suggestion of Gotzon Madariaga:
                     since these are ceiling/floor values a measurable
                     uncertainty is pointless (BMcM)
   2003-10-01  Fixed some typos following checking by IDB (BMcM)
   2003-10-03  BMcM: Final editorial pass. Added _related_function alternate
                     to _exptl_crystal_colour. Also added this flag to the
                     new items which replace existing ones:
                     _atom_site_refinement_flags_* and the _space_group_ items
   2003-10-04  Release version 2.3. IUCr
   2004-06-06  BMcM: minor editorial changes for International Tables Volume G.
                     Text of _atom_sites_*_tran_* definitions changed to
                     ATOM_SITE from STOM_SITES.
                       Some realignment of examples to fit column width.
   2004-09-11  BMcM: corrected related item error in
                     _atom_site_refinement_flags_posn, *_adp and *_occupancy

    _definition
;              A code which identifies a group of positionally disordered atom
               sites that are locally simultaneously occupied. Atoms that are
               positionally disordered over two or more sites (e.g. the hydrogen
               atoms of a methyl group that exists in two orientations) can
               be assigned to two or more groups. Sites belonging to the same
               group are simultaneously occupied, but those belonging to
               different groups are not. A minus prefix (e.g. "-1") is used to
               indicate sites disordered about a special position.

    _definition
;              The _atom_site_label is a unique identifier for a particular site
               in the crystal. This code is made up of a sequence of up to seven
               components, _atom_site_label_component_0 to *_6, which may be
               specified as separate data items. Component 0 usually matches one
               of the specified _atom_type_symbol codes. This is not mandatory
               if an _atom_site_type_symbol item is included in the atom-site
               list. The _atom_site_type_symbol always takes precedence over
               an _atom_site_label in the identification of the atom type. The
               label components 1 to 6 are optional, and normally only
               components 0 and 1 are used. Note that components 0 and 1 are
               concatenated, while all other components, if specified, are
               separated by an underscore. Underscores are
               only used if higher-order components exist. If an intermediate
               component is not used, it may be omitted provided the underscore
               separators are inserted. For example, the label 'C233__ggg' is
               acceptable and represents the components C, 233, '' and ggg.
               Different labels may have a different number of components.

;              Component 0 is normally a code which matches identically with
               one of the _atom_type_symbol codes. If this is the case, then the
               rules governing the _atom_type_symbol code apply. If, however,
               the data item _atom_site_type_symbol is also specified in the
               atom-site list, component 0 need not match this symbol or adhere
               to any of the _atom_type_symbol rules.
               Component 1 is referred to as the "atom number". When component 0
               is the atom-type code, it is used to number the sites with the
               same atom type. This component code must start with at least one
               digit which is not followed by a + or - sign (to distinguish it
               from the component 0 rules).
               Components 2 to 6 contain the identifier, residue, sequence,
               asymmetry identifier and alternate codes, respectively. These
               codes may be composed of any characters except an underscore.

;              Data items in the _chemical_conn_atom_ and _chemical_conn_bond_
               categories record details about the two-dimensional (2D)
               chemical structure of the molecular species. They allow a 2D
               chemical diagram to be reconstructed for use in a publication or
               in a database search for structural and substructural
               relationships.

               The _chemical_conn_atom_ data items provide information about
               the chemical properties of the atoms in the structure. In cases
               where crystallographic and molecular symmetry elements coincide,
               they must also contain symmetry-generated atoms, so that the
               _chemical_conn_atom_ and _chemical_conn_bond_ data items will
               always describe a complete chemical entity.

    _definition
;              _chemical_formula_ items specify the composition and chemical
              properties of the compound. The formula data items must agree
              with those that specify the density, unit-cell and Z values.

              The following rules apply to the construction of the data items
              _chemical_formula_analytical, *_structural and *_sum. For the
              data item *_moiety, the formula construction is broken up into
              residues or moieties, i.e. groups of atoms that form a molecular
              unit or molecular ion. The  rules given below apply within each
              moiety but different requirements apply to the way that moieties
              are connected (see _chemical_formula_moiety).

              (1) Only recognized element symbols may be used.

              (2) Each element symbol is followed by a 'count' number. A
                 count of '1' may be omitted.

              (3) A space or parenthesis must separate each cluster of (element
                 symbol + count).

              (4) Where a group of elements is enclosed in parentheses, the
                 multiplier for the group must follow the closing parenthesis.
                 That is, all element and group multipliers are assumed to be
                 printed as subscripted numbers. (An exception to this rule
                 exists for *_moiety formulae where pre- and post-multipliers
                 are permitted for molecular units.)

              (5) Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds
                 to their chemical structure, as in
                 _chemical_formula_structural, the order of the elements within
                 any group or moiety depends on whether carbon is present or
                 not. If carbon is present, the order should be: C, then H,
                 then the other elements in alphabetical order of their
                 symbol. If carbon is not present, the elements are listed
                 purely in alphabetical order of their symbol. This is the
                 'Hill' system used by Chemical Abstracts. This ordering is
                 used in _chemical_formula_moiety and _chemical_formula_sum.

                  (2) The order of elements within a moiety follows general rule
                     (5) in the _chemical_formula_[] category description.
                  (3) Parentheses are not used within moieties but may surround
                     a moiety. Parentheses may not be nested.
                  (4) Charges should be placed at the end of the moiety. The
                     charge '+' or '-' may be preceded by a numerical multiplier
                     and should be separated from the last (element symbol +

;              Data items in the DIFFRN_REFLN category record details about
               the intensities measured in the diffraction experiment.

               The DIFFRN_REFLN data items refer to individual intensity
               measurements and must be included in looped lists.

               (The DIFFRN_REFLNS data items specify the parameters that apply
               to all intensity  measurements. The DIFFRN_REFLNS data items
               are not looped.)

               intensity of the set of standard reflections measured at the
               start of the measurement process and at the finish.  This value
               usually affords a measure of the overall decay in crystal
               quality during the diffraction measurement process.  Negative
               values are used in exceptional instances where the final
               intensities are greater than the initial ones.  If no
               measurable decay has occurred, the standard uncertainty should
               be quoted to indicate the maximum possible value the decay
               might have.  A range of 3 standard uncertainties is considered
               possible.  Thus 0.0(1) would indicate a decay of less than
               0.3% or an enhancement of less than 0.3%.

    ;  All esds (except the esd in the dihedral angle between
       two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance
       matrix. The cell esds are taken into account individually
       in the estimation of esds in distances, angles and
       torsion angles; correlations between esds in cell
       parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal
       symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell
       esds is used for estimating esds involving l.s. planes.

               The character string n_klm is composed as follows:

               n refers to the symmetry operation that is applied to the
               coordinates stored in _atom_site_fract_x, _atom_site_fract_y
               and _atom_site_fract_z. It must match a number given in
               _space_group_symop_id.

               k, l and m refer to the translations that are subsequently
               applied to the symmetry-transformed coordinates to generate
               the atom used in calculating the angle. These translations
               (x,y,z) are related to (k,l,m) by the relations
                    k = 5 + x
                    l = 5 + y
                    m = 5 + z
               By adding 5 to the translations, the use of negative numbers
               is avoided.

    Example 2 - An example showing a listing of only symmetry-unique bonds.
                In high-symmetry structures when many bonds are related by
                symmetry, it may not be necessary or desirable to list all
                the bonds in the environment of the first named atom. Some
                users may wish to give only the symmetry-independent
                distances and supply a multiplicity to indicate how many
                such bonds are found in the atomic environment.

               *_label_2 to *_label_3 is the viewing direction, and the torsion
               angle is the angle of twist required to superimpose the
               projection of the vector between site 2 and site 1 onto the
               projection of the vector between site 3 and site 4. Clockwise
               torsions are positive, anticlockwise torsions are negative.

    _definition
;              The symmetry code of each atom site as the symmetry-equivalent
               position number 'n' and the cell translation number 'klm'.
               These numbers are combined to form the code 'n klm' or n_klm.
               The character string n_klm is composed as follows:

               n refers to the symmetry operation that is applied to the
               coordinates stored in _atom_site_fract_x, _atom_site_fract_y
               and _atom_site_fract_z. It must match a number given in
               _space_group_symop_id.

               k, l and m refer to the translations that are subsequently
               applied to the symmetry-transformed coordinates to generate
               the atom used in calculating the angle. These translations
               (x,y,z) are related to (k,l,m) by the relations
                    k = 5 + x
                    l = 5 + y
                    m = 5 + z
               By adding 5 to the translations, the use of negative numbers
               is avoided.

    ;  The oxazolidinone ring is a shallow envelope
       conformation with the tert-butyl and iso-butyl groups
       occupying trans-positions with respect to the ring. The
       angles at the N atom sum to 356.2\%, indicating a very
       small degree of pyramidalization at this atom. This is
       consistent with electron delocalization between the N
       atom and the carbonyl centre [N-C=O = 1.374(3)\%A].

               a standard format with sections tagged by specific data names
               (such as in Acta Crystallographica Section C). Typically,
               each journal will supply a list of the specific items it
               requires in its Notes for Authors.

    _definition
;              A description of the extinction-correction method applied.
               This description should
               include information about the correction method, either
               'Becker-Coppens' or 'Zachariasen'. The latter is sometimes
               referred to as the 'Larson' method even though it employs
               Zachariasen's formula.

               The Becker-Coppens procedure is referred to as 'type 1' when
               correcting secondary extinction dominated by the mosaic spread;
               as 'type 2' when secondary extinction is dominated by particle
               size and includes a primary extinction component; and as 'mixed'
               when there is a mixture of types 1 and 2.

               For the Becker-Coppens method, it is also necessary to set the
               mosaic distribution as either 'Gaussian' or 'Lorentzian' and
               the nature of the extinction as 'isotropic' or 'anisotropic'.
               Note that if either the 'mixed' or 'anisotropic' corrections
               are applied, the multiple coefficients cannot be contained in
               *_extinction_coef and must be listed in _refine_special_details.

               another). Least-squares restraints often depend on geometry or
               energy considerations and this makes their direct contribution
               to this number, and to the goodness-of-fit calculation,
               difficult to assess.

;              The proportion of Friedel-related reflections present in
               the number of 'independent' reflections specified by
               the item _reflns_number_total.

               This proportion is calculated as the ratio:

                 [N(crystal class) - N(Laue symmetry)] / N(Laue symmetry)

               where, working from the _diffrn_refln_ list,

               N(crystal class) is the number of reflections obtained on
                  averaging under the symmetry of the crystal class
               N(Laue symmetry) is the number of reflections obtained on
                  averaging under the Laue symmetry.

               Examples:
                 (a) For centrosymmetric structures, _reflns_Friedel_coverage
                     is necessarily equal to 0.0 as the crystal class
                     is identical to the Laue symmetry.
                 (b) For whole-sphere data for a crystal in the space
                     group P1, _reflns_Friedel_coverage is equal to 1.0,
                     as no reflection h k l is equivalent to -h -k -l
                     in the crystal class and all Friedel pairs
                     {h k l; -h -k -l} have been measured.
                 (c) For whole-sphere data in space group Pmm2,
                     _reflns_Friedel_coverage will be < 1.0 because
                     although reflections h k l and
                     -h -k -l are not equivalent when h k l indices are
                     nonzero, they are when l=0.
                 (d) For a crystal in the space group Pmm2, measurements of the
                     two inequivalent octants h >= 0, k >=0, l lead to the
                     same value as in (c), whereas measurements of the
                     two equivalent octants h >= 0, k, l >= 0 will lead to
                     a value of zero for _reflns_Friedel_coverage.

    _definition
;              Contains all the data items that refer to the space group as a
               whole, such as its name or crystal system. They may be looped,
               for example, in a list of space groups and their properties.

               Only a subset of the SPACE_GROUP category items appear in the
               core dictionary.  The remainder are found in the symmetry CIF
               dictionary.

               Space-group types are identified by their number as given in
               International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A. Specific
               settings of the space groups can be identified either by their
               Hall symbol or by specifying their symmetry operations.

               The commonly used Hermann-Mauguin symbol determines the
               space-group type uniquely but several different Hermann-Mauguin
               symbols may refer to the same space-group type. A
               Hermann-Mauguin symbol contains information on the choice of
               the basis, but not on the choice of origin.  Different formats
               for the Hermann-Mauguin symbol are found in the symmetry CIF
               dictionary.

;              _space_group_name_H-M_alt allows any Hermann-Mauguin symbol
               to be given. The way in which this item is used is determined
               by the user and in general is not intended to be interpreted by
               computer. It may, for example, be used to give one of the
               extended Hermann-Mauguin symbols given in Table 4.3.2.1 of
               International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A (2002) or
               a Hermann-Mauguin symbol for a conventional or unconventional
               setting.

               Each component of the space-group name is separated by a
               space or an underscore. The use of a space is strongly
               recommended.  The underscore is only retained because it
               was used in older files. It should not be
               used in new CIFs. Subscripts should appear without special
               symbols. Bars should be given as negative signs before the
               numbers to which they apply.

               The commonly used Hermann-Mauguin symbol determines the space-
               group type uniquely but a given space-group type may be
               described by more than one Hermann-Mauguin symbol. The space-
               group type is best described using _space_group_IT_number.

               The Hermann-Mauguin symbol may contain information on the
               choice of basis, but not on the choice of origin. To
               define the setting uniquely, use _space_group_name_Hall or
               list the symmetry operations.

    _definition
;               A parsable string giving one of the symmetry operations of the
                space group in algebraic form.  If W is a matrix representation
                of the rotational part of the symmetry operation defined by the
                positions and signs of x, y and z, and w is a column of
                translations defined by fractions, an equivalent position
                X' is generated from a given position X by the equation

                          X' = WX + w

                (Note: X is used to represent bold_italics_x in International
                Tables for Crystallography Vol. A, Part 5)

                When a list of symmetry operations is given, it must contain
                a complete set of coordinate representatives which generates
                all the operations of the space group by the addition of
                all primitive translations of the space group. Such
                representatives are to be found as the coordinates of
                the general-equivalent position in International Tables for
                Crystallography Vol. A (2002), to which it is necessary to 
                add any centring translations shown above the 
                general-equivalent position.

                That is to say, it is necessary to list explicitly all the
                symmetry operations required to generate all the atoms in
                the unit cell defined by the setting used.

               In order for the defaults to work correctly, the identity
               operation should have _space_group_symop_id or
               _symmetry_equiv_pos_site_id set to 1, and

;              A code identifying each entry in the _symmetry_equiv_pos_as_xyz
               list. It is normally the sequence number of the entry in that
               list, and should be identified with the code 'n' in
               _geom_*_symmetry_ codes of the form 'n_klm'.

               In order for the defaults to work correctly, the identity
               operation should have _space_group_symop_id or
               _symmetry_equiv_pos_site_id set to 1, and
               _space_group_symop_operation_xyz or
               _symmetry_equiv_pos_as_xyz set to x,y,z; 
               i.e. the operation labelled 1 should be the identity
               operation.
