Contributors to the critic2 code:

* Jose Luis Casals Sainz at the University of Oviedo
  <joseluiscasalssainz@gmail.com>:
  Merge-sort routine in tools.f90

* Enrico Benassi at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, Italy 
  <ebenassi3@gmail.com>:
  The STM module is based on one of Enrico's program, who also
  provided guidance and encouragement.

* Robin Myhr, Isaac Visintainer, and Richard Greaves at the University
  of British Columbia (Okanagan):
  Initial version of the graphical interface.

Critic2 contains code from the following sources. The complete
copyright notice is included in the corresponding files.

* ciftbx: fortran routines for CIF data, by Sydney R. Hall and Herbert
  J. Bernstein. 

  http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/ciftbx/

  The ciftbx package is included in critic2. It is invoked when the
  crystal structure is given as a cif file. ciftbx is distributed
  under the GNU/GPL v2.
  
* abinit: electronic structure of periodic solids under the
  pseudopotentials/plane-waves approximation. The lead developers are
  X. Gonze and D. C. Allan, with contributions from many people (see
  doc/developers/contributors.txt) in the abinit distribution.

  Modified versions of some of the routines for reading DEN files are
  used in abinit_private. The grid interpolation routine (trispline)
  also comes from abinit, and was written by A. Lherbier. abinit is
  distributed under the GNU/GPL v3.

* wien2k: a FP-LAPW program for calculations in periodic solids, by
  P. Blaha, K. Schwarz and others (http://www.wien2k.at/). The
  routines for reading struct files and calculate the electron density
  were adapted (with permission) from the WIEN2k code.

* elk: a FP-LAPW program for calculations in periodic solids, by
  J. K. Dewhurst, S. Sharma, C. Ambrosch-Draxl, and others.

  Modified versions of the routines dealing with the elk file formats
  and densities are in elk_private.f90. Also, the cfftnd.f90 file is
  an almost exact copy of the equivalent file in elk, which in turn is
  part of the fftpack5 library by P. Swarztrauber and Richard Valent. 
  
  elk is distributed under the GNU/GPL v3.

* spglib: the spglib library is used to calculate symmetry information
  for the crystal structures in critic2. spglib was created and is
  maintained by Atsushi Togo (atztogo.github.io/spglib). A static copy
  of the 1.9.0 version of spglib is shipped with critic2 (src/spglib).
  See src/spglib/COPYING for license details.

* cubpack: a package for the automatic integration of n-dimensional
  integration regions by numerical cubature. The authors are Alan Genz
  and Ronald Cools. Adapted by J. Burkardt.

* The routines for Lebedev integration on the sphere were developed
  and coded by V. I. Lebedev and D. N. Laikov. See the header of
  integration.f90 for details.

* The keast library (keast.f90) does numerical integration on
  tetrahedra. They were developed by A. Nijenhuis and Herbert
  Wilf. Converted to fortran90 by J. Burkardt. The library is
  distributed under the GNU/LGPL license.

* The routines dealing with aiPI ion files (pi_private.f90) were
  adapted from the PI code, by V. Luaña, E. Francisco,
  A. Martín-Pendás, M. Flórez, M. Bermejo, and M. Álvarez Blanco.

* Part of the LAPACK (and BLAS) library are included in the oldlibs/
  directory, by J. Dongarra and others. LAPACK is under the BSD-new
  license. 

* A modified version of the quadpack library is used (quadpack.f90)
  for vectorial 1D integration. Quadpack was written by R. Piessens,
  E. de Doncker, C. Ueberhuber, and D. Kahaner. See
  www.netlib.org/quadpack. The version included in critic2 was taken
  from John Burkardt's page
  (http://orion.math.iastate.edu/burkardt/f_src/f_src.html).

* Part of the bader program sources. Bader is a program for the
  integration of scalar fields on a grid developed by Graeme Henkelman
  and collaborators at the University of Texas at Austin. The 'bader'
  program was written by Wenjie Tang, Andri Arnaldsson, Samuel T.
  Chill, and Graeme Henkelman, and distributed under a free license
  (GNU/GPL). See the copyright notice in src/bader.f90 for more
  details. 

* The qhull library is used to calculate the vertices and faces of the
  Wigner-Seitz cell, which is an essential component in several parts
  of critic2. The author of the library is C. B. Barber and the
  Geometry Center at the University of Minnesota. Qhull is free
  software and a copy of the library is distributed with critic2. The
  exact licensing conditions can be read in src/qhull/COPYING.txt.
  Qhull may be obtained via http from www.qhull.org.

* The Gaussian wfn/wfx code has been adapted from postg, by Alberto
  Otero de la Roza, Felix Kannemann, Erin R. Johnson, Ross M. Dickson,
  Hartmut Schmider, and Axel D. Becke. Postg calculates the dispersion
  energy and related quantities in the exchange-hole dipole moment. It
  is distributed under GPL.

* The SPGR symmetry library has been adapted by A. Martín Pendás from
  earlier work by Allen C. Larson at the National Research Council of
  Canada. 

* The tricubic interpolation routine is based on code by David Kirkby
  at the University of California, Irvine
  (https://github.com/deepzot/likely).

* The part of the grid_read_unk routine that reads wannnier90
  checkpoints has been adapted from wannier90, version
  2.0.1. Wannier90 is authored by Jonathan Yates, Arash Mostofi,       
  Giovanni Pizzi, Young-Su Lee, Nicola Marzari, Ivo Souza, and David
  Vanderbilt. Distributed under the GNU/GPL v2.

* The graphical interface (GUI) contains a copy of the Immediate Mode
  Graphical User interface (ImGui), coded by Omar Cornut with
  contributions from others (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

  The matrix and quaternion manipulation library
  (src-gui/matrix_math.*) comes from the OGLdev tutorials, by Etay
  Meiri (http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/index.html).

  The GUI also uses the font rasterization library of the STB package,
  by Sean Barrett and others (https://github.com/nothings/stb).
